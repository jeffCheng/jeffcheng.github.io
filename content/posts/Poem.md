## Love Poem
**I** stand with you.\
**L**eave fall down but spring.\
**O**h, your beauty is so full that.\
**V**anity would never seize you.\
**E**verywhere can feel happiness\
**U**ntil the sun bring another wind.\
**W**atch you sleep and\
**I** don't ever wanna leave.\
**N**ow and never, I love you.\
**N**ow I think it's time to say:\
**Y**ou and I will travel far together until forever.
